 ### Hey there ! 
I'm _terminus_, doing Bachelor's in Computer Science at University of Regina (a freshman)  
- Currently I'm learning on cpp and Javascript
- I'm open to learn anything on any project, just ping me.
- you can contact me through my mail which is (terminus04@protom.me)
- Funfact : I'll never say no to learning and trying new things :)
